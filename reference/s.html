Crafting day trading applications at Citadel LLC, I set new standards for user interaction and real-time performance, showcasing a seamless blend of technology with user needs. As a co-founder of a legal tech startup, I challenged industry norms with a groundbreaking contract editor, embodying my entrepreneurial spirit and vision for future-forward solutions. Rooted in a Computer Science B.S. from the University of Virginia, my journey is marked by relentless pursuit of excellence, innovation, and transformative leadership in technology. \u003c/p\u003e","fieldCD":"FRFM","dateTimeValue":null}],"index":1,"id":"04c85297-457e-49e4-a37f-479c8fd45aec","category":null}],"index":4,"name":"Professional Summary","id":"f842c303-4fde-4853-8b4c-1a8f07323112"},{"sectionTypeCD":"OVVW","preferences":[],"paragraphs":[{"docDatas":[{"charValue":"15","fieldCD":"NMBR","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"years of professional experience","fieldCD":"FRFM","dateTimeValue":null}],"index":null,"id":"2f4c9447-631e-4a24-ac6c-9d958d3690d7","category":"EXPR"}],"index":5,"name":"Overview","id":"9b97fb7c-8abe-4119-815f-82b34df3a1e7"},{"sectionTypeCD":"EXPR","preferences":[],"paragraphs":[{"docDatas":[{"charValue":"08 2023","fieldCD":"JSTD","dateTimeValue":"2023-08-05T05:00:00.000Z"},{"charValue":"Current","fieldCD":"EDDT","dateTimeValue":"2024-03-12T20:16:20.154Z"},{"charValue":"Centric Software","fieldCD":"COMP","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"Principal Software Engineer","fieldCD":"JTIT","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"","fieldCD":"JCIT","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"","fieldCD":"JSTA","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"","fieldCD":"JCNT","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"\u003cul \u003e \u003cli \u003e Developed features for Centric's product lifecycle management software, a highly interactive app that leverages ReactJS, MobX, ElasticSearch, NodeJS \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e","fieldCD":"JDES","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"","fieldCD":"JCTR","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"","fieldCD":"JDFM","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"","fieldCD":"JLOC","dateTimeValue":null}],"index":1,"id":"3ca79663-4611-4ffc-86ae-ef05fcbdf00f","category":null},{"docDatas":[{"charValue":"10 2018","fieldCD":"JSTD","dateTimeValue":"2018-10-05T05:00:00.000Z"},{"charValue":"02 2023","fieldCD":"EDDT","dateTimeValue":"2023-02-05T06:00:00.000Z"},{"charValue":"FTD","fieldCD":"COMP","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"Director of Software Engineering","fieldCD":"JTIT","dateTimeValue":null},{"charValue":"\u003cp\u003eFTD, established in 1910 as \"Flowers Transwire Delivery\" (now Flowers Transworld Delivery), is an e-commerce clearing how for it's florist network that has evolved with the times from wire, to phone, and finally to web applications.
